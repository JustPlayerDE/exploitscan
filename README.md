# exploitscan

With this small tool you can check for simple netstring exploits (at least public ones)

You can run it via

`lua_run http.Fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustPlayerDE/exploitscan/master/init.lua", function(body) RunString(body) end)`

It will simply download the json "database" and search for netstrings listed in the json (and notify you if it exists and also tells you
where the handler was defined)

Please check the code before running the command.

This is open for Pull-Request (for example definition updates) ^^

_This cannot find badly written and exploitable code_
